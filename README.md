# Strapped Four Time
## A simple starter theme that combines [Underscores](http://underscores.me/) simple starter theme and a stripped down [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/).

Getting Started
1. Clone the repo.
2. Add Bootstrap 4 as a submodule in the scss/bootstrap-grid/ folder. Thanks [JonathanMH](https://jonathanmh.com/bootstrap-4-grid-only-and-sass-with-gulp/) for the tutorial. Move into the scss/bootstrap-grid/ folder and follow these steps:
    git submodule add https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git
    cd bootstrap
    git checkout remotes/origin/v4-dev

Next Steps
I recommend setting up a sass workflow with Grunt. If you're new [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-grunt-and-sass/) has a great tutorial.
